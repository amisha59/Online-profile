		            	<p>Many health problems are seen nowadays due to technology. Many people don't have the concept only phone, computers are technologies but we use technology for each and every thing. Because of the vehicle, people feel lazy to walk even a small distance deu to which people suffer from many diseases like chronic disease, including overweight and type 2 diabetes. evidence of the biological efffects associated with the lack of movement date further back than you might think-straight into the human fossil records.<br>

		            	People are getting closer to the fake world and getting far from their real world. Now, in every family gathering their is the trend of photograph and posting on facebook, instagram. The actual meaning of clicking a photogram is to see and to fresh the memories if that particular time. But, posting in facebook comparing the number of like and comments you get is all bullshit. The technology has made all people very busy. People find the chatting in facebook more interesting rather to talk with family and spend quality time.</p>

	            			<p>Though, technology helped alot in positive way in education sector but the students miss used the technology and made their decisions of life just in fun. The students are more focused in their extra online stuffs rather than studies. Technologies can be used for studies as we can search for any word  or any meaning which we don't know but instead of doing that students are busy chatting and making friends through online whom they haven't met in real life. Many cyber crime is done with the help of hacking and stuffs. Though it is illigal people are not scared of the punishment. People find it nothing to hack anyone's account and share any kind of post that is humiliating but the one that faces the problem suffers the most. Rather than using the internet and other technology in a good way the people specially the young generation misuses the most.<br>
